== README

This app is still very much in progress (so many of the features in the description have not been implemented yet), and I may well re-write entirely, after finishing Makers Academy, due to it not having been built using TDD; plus it would probably benefit from being re-written, to get DRY'd up and just be written following better practices generally.


Notes for myself:

Make it so people can add words to your wordlist (subject to your approval)

Crowd-sourced word lists / vocabulary lists. Good for disasters too.

Info for disasters.
