== README

This app is still in progress and, in fact, I will likely re-write it entirely, using my post-Makers Academy skills.

Technologies used include Rails, Sass and Bootstrap. User Authentication uses the Devise gem.

It is hosted on Heroku [here](https://fathomless-stream-7071.herokuapp.com/)

If you want to run this locally:
- Install Ruby
- `git clone git@github.com:Yorkshireman/mywordlist.git`
- `bundle`
- `rake db:create`
- `rake db:migrate`
- `rails s`
- Go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
  
Sign-up and add Words with definitions and categories.  
In your Wordlist you can click on categories to display only words with that category.
